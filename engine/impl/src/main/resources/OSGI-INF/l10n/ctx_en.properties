ctx.ocd.name=BasicContext-Configuration
ctx.ocd.description=Configuration of an BasicContext.
name.name=Name
name.description=The human readable name of the Context
description.name=Description
description.description=The human readable description of the Context

aggregateRuleTag.name=AggregateRuleTag
aggregateRuleTag.description=String property that is the AggRule element's tag value. Normally, this property is not set by a user.

generateAggregateSql.name=AggregateRuleTag
generateAggregateSql.description=Boolean property that controls whether to print the SQL code generated for aggregate tables. If set, then as each aggregate request is processed, both the lost and collapsed dimension create and insert sql code is printed. This is for use in the CmdRunner allowing one to create aggregate table generation sql.

disableLocalSegmentCache.name=DisableLocalSegmentCache
disableLocalSegmentCache.description=Boolean property that controls whether the data from segments is cached locally. To create custom caches, look for the SegmentCache SPI.

enableTriggers.name=EnableTriggers
enableTriggers.description=Boolean property that controls whether to notify the Mondrian system when a {@link MondrianProperties property value} changes. This allows objects dependent on Mondrian properties to react (that is, reload), when a given property changes via, say, <code>MondrianProperties.instance().populate(null)</code> or <code>MondrianProperties.instance().QueryLimit.set(50)</code>.

generateFormattedSql.name=GenerateFormattedSql
generateFormattedSql.description=Boolean property that controls pretty-print mode. If true, the all SqlQuery SQL strings will be generated in pretty-print mode, formatted for ease of reading.

enableNonEmptyOnAllAxis.name=EnableNonEmptyOnAllAxis
enableNonEmptyOnAllAxis.description=Boolean property that controls whether each query axis implicit has the NON EMPTY option set. The default is false.

expandNonNative.name=ExpandNonNative
expandNonNative.description=If this property is true, when looking for native evaluation of an expression, Mondrian will expand non-native sub-expressions into lists of members.

compareSiblingsByOrderKey.name=CompareSiblingsByOrderKey
compareSiblingsByOrderKey.description=Boolean property that controls whether sibling members are compared according to order key value fetched from their ordinal expression.  The default is false (only database ORDER BY is used).

enableExpCache.name=EnableExpCache
enableExpCache.description=Boolean property that controls whether to use a cache for frequently evaluated expressions. With the cache disabled, an expression like <code>Rank([Product].CurrentMember, Order([Product].MEMBERS, [Measures].[Unit Sales]))</code> would performmany redundant sorts. The default is true.

testExpDependencies.name=TestExpDependencies
testExpDependencies.description=Integer property that controls whether to test operators' dependencies, and how much time to spend doing it. If this property is positive, Mondrian's test framework allocates ane xpression evaluator which evaluates each expression several times, and makes sure that the results of the expression are independent of dimensions which the expression claims to be independent of. The default is 0.

testSeed.name=TestSeed
testSeed.description=Seed for random number generator used by some of the tests. Any value besides 0 or -1 gives deterministic behavior. The default value is 1234: most users should use this.Setting the seed to a different value can increase coverage, and therefore may uncover new bugs. If you set the value to 0, the system will generate its own pseudo-random seed. If you set the value to -1, Mondrian uses the next seed from an internal random-number generator. This is a little more deterministic than setting the value to 0.

localePropFile.name=LocalePropFile
localePropFile.description=String property that holds the name of the class whose resource bundle is to be used to for this schema. For example, if the class is {@code com.acme.MyResource}, mondrian will look for a resource bundle called {@code com/acme/MyResource_<i>locale</i>.properties} on the class path. (This property has a confusing name because in a previous release it actually held a file name.) Used for the {@link mondrian.i18n.LocalizingDynamicSchemaProcessor}; see Internationalization for more details.
